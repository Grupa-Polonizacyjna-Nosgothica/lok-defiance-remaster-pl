Here, no doubt, was the evidence
Moebius wished me to have...
For the Vampires had prophesied not one,
but two champions -
one
destined to be Nosgoth's redeemer,
the other
its destroyer.
The Vampires' hero wielded the Reaver,
forged for this very purpose.
His opponent
was clearly the champion of their adversaries -
the Hylden -
and brandished a flaming sword.
The foretold outcome
was unambiguous:
the Vampire hero
would fall.
