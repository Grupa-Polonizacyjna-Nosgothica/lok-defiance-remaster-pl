History is written by the victors.
Beneath the vaults of Avernus
I discovered scenes that told a familiar story,
but from a very different point of view.
This was the work of the enemy race,
and revealed what the Vampire histories
had conveniently omitted --
how the noble Vampires,
god-ridden and righteous,
had started the wars
that would destroy both races,
victor and vanquished alike.
Their adversaries opposed the Vampires' god,
and refused to submit to the Wheel of Fate -
for this they were banished.
I now understood the
poetic irony of their curse.
And my resemblance to the Vampires' enemy
no longer seemed so accidental.
