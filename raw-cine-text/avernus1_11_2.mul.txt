-- Kain.
Why is this no surprise?
-- Because our destinies run together, Raziel,
like two rivers that have met
and can never be distinct again.
At your every fatal turn,
you will find me.
-- And the free will you said was mine,
what has become of that?
-- You still have it.
And that has everything to do
with my presence here now.
-- It was your machinations that set my destiny in motion.
The coin you tossed has struck the earth.
Now you must abide by its outcome.
-- The coin is still turning, Raziel.
To reach the resolution we both can live with,
that will best serve our futures,
Janos Audron
must not be raised.
-- Because you do not wish it?
Is my free will to be exercised
only when it accords with your whim?
-- There is much more at stake in this than you know.
-- Yes,
and it is Janos who has the answers I desire.
-- You must trust me, Raziel.
Our intentions -
for Nosgoth,
for our futures -
are not so diverse.
-- I must trust you --
or?
-- I have not come here to threaten you, Raziel.
-- You say that,
while you hold in your hand the instrument of my doom?
-- I saved you from the Reaver once.
I have no intention of imprisoning you
within the blade.
-- At least not until the moment it serves your plans to do so.
-- You are not the only one at risk.
I may carry the instrument of your destruction,
but I, too,
have taken a chance in coming here.
Or haven't you realized --
you bear the only weapon
that can kill me.
-- Then you know what I am --
and who you are?
-- I believe I do.
-- And still you think you can move me
about like your pawn.
Think again, Kain.
-- Take heed, Raziel.
-- Why?
If we are who we are,
then are we not destined to fight to the death,
to decide the fate of Nosgoth?
-- Don't be a fool.
I will not fight you.
-- And that will be the prophesied heroes' battle?
I win,
because you will not fight me?
The mighty Kain,
Scion of Balance,
would-be savior of Nosgoth,
surrenders before the final battle
even begins --
-- Very well,
if this
will make you see reason --
