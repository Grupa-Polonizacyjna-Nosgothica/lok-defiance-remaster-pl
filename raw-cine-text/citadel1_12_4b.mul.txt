-- Where have you brought me?
-- We are within the ancient citadel
of the Vampire race,
long ago defiled and abandoned.
This fortress
endured through centuries of war
against our great enemy -
-- the Hylden.
-- Yes.
From this chamber
we witnessed the summoning of the Pillars,
and the banishment of our adversaries from the land.
This is a dire omen...
The Binding is in peril -
the hour of prophecy is at hand.
-- It's too late.
The Pillars are already damned.
-- As long as a single one of us stands,
there is still hope.
The Pillars must not remain
under human guardianship.
They are not competent to serve.
-- Why then did you allow the Pillars
to fall into human hands?
-- Raziel, there is no time--
-- I want answers.
The world can end this instant, for all I care.
-- Very well.
The Hylden cursed us as they fell,
afflicting our race with a predatory
blood-thirst.
But with this transformation
came our enemies' true revenge:
immortality.
-- They liberated you from the Wheel of Fate.
-- They imprisoned
our souls in this flesh,
expelling us from the purifying cycle of death
and rebirth.
-- And yet you passed the curse on.
-- It was a necessary evil.
Our immortality
banished us from God's grace -
He turned His sight from us,
and fell silent.
Many took their own lives,
unable to bear the separation from our God.
-- Not you, though.
-- Curse or blessing,
it is the price we pay
to keep the Hylden banished from the land.
To sustain the Binding,
we had to preserve our bloodline.
And so we passed
the dark gift to the human successors
of our fallen Guardians.
They rebelled,
inevitably,
refusing the curse
and seizing the Pillars as their own.
And so we come to our present dilemma.
While mankind governs the Pillars,
the Binding decays.
The Hylden
strain against the barriers
of their prison,
scratching to gain a foothold
back into this world.
-- And what does all this mean to me?
-- We stand
at the threshold of a new aeon,
Raziel,
and you are the fulcrum
upon which our destiny turns.
Beneath this room
lies our innermost sanctum -
- the outer chamber has been opened.
It appears events are already in motion.
This token
is the key to the mysteries you seek.
I cannot accompany you;
you must face this trial alone.
If you prevail,
you will have your answers.
-- And if I fail the test?
-- Then
you will not return.
