And so I arrived
at the citadel of my Vampire ancestors,
long abandoned since their extinction
eons ago.
Perhaps it still held
the wisdom of its creators.
Here
Moebius said I would find
proof that Raziel was not
what I thought he was --
or hoped he would be.
But in sending me here
Moebius had done me an unexpected --
or perhaps
an unwitting --
service.
For it was my destiny,
not Raziel's -
my role as Scion of Balance -
whose secrets I was here to discover.
