-- Now -
you will listen to me.
The Heart of Darkness must remain undiscovered.
Great harm will come of its use.
-- You don't know where it is, do you?
-- No -
-- you never looked for it.
-- It doesn't matter, Raziel.
Listen to me -
you must understand that every creature
is bound to one predestined path.
We are all shackled--
-- to the Wheel of Fate.
Believe me,
I know that even better than you do.
-- All but one.
Because of your remaking,
you are the one unbound creature,
the one among us all
=
=
that truly has free will.
You have a choice,
Raziel --
-- Which I'm sure I must make at your direction.
Your pawn has reached the end
of the board, Kain.
And now my powers may even
surpass yours.
How ironic
if the creature that you made
should prove your own undoing.
Now -
we finish this.
Once and for all.
