Here the images were unadulterated,
and their meaning ominously clear...
The Vampire hero,
the bearer of the Reaver blade,
was confronted by an adversary
worthy of his powers.
The enemy race,
long banished,
had a champion of their own -
with flaming eyes, and a fiery sword.
The resemblance I bore to the adversary
mocked all my hopes.
Had Kain been the Vampire hero of
prophecy all along?
Did he suspect what I was?
For if I was this foretold adversary,
then Moebius was right,
and had always been right --
I was destined to fight Kain,
and destroy him...
or be destroyed.
What part did free will play in any of this?...
