In their defeat,
the Vampires' enemy retaliated with a
terrible curse -
afflicting the Vampires with a bloodthirst
that turned their once-noble race
into ravenous predators.
This curse plunged the Vampires into despair,
and apparently drove many to madness
and self annihilation.
What was it that so devastated them
that they were driven to suicide?
