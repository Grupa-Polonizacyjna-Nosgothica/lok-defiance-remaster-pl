-- For my ancient ancestors,
the dark gift was clearly a curse,
damning them to a kind of spiritual purgatory.
But why were they compelled
to seal this chamber so securely?
Perhaps the lock was not meant to keep intruders out,
but to imprison something within...
-- Kain...
Scion of Balance.
Savior of Nosgoth.
-- What is this?
-- Your arrival is foretold...
The Fates have willed it.
-- Is that so.
-- I am the Oracle of your ancestors.
I can provide the answers you require...
You needn't speak;
I know your mind.
You seek knowledge of your creature, Raziel...
this I can offer,
if you will look.
He has found the body of Janos Audron...
He journeys now to Avernus Cathedral
to seek the Heart of Darkness.
You know what this means...
-- And why would I trust your prophecies?
-- These events are already written,
just as you feared.
But there is still time;
he can be stopped.
-- If Avernus is in flames,
Raziel is five centuries beyond my reach.
-- I may aid you in this regard as well...
This portal will transport you in time to the
very hour that Raziel arrives in Avernus.
This task is yours to carry out...
since it was you
who made him what he is.
When you are ready,
you may pass through.
-- I knew of course that this
'oracle'
was not to be trusted.
But in the end,
what choice did I have?
