These images
chronicled Vorador's creation.
As I already knew,
he had not been born a vampire,
but had been turned
by the infamous Janos Audron.
But this mural suggested that Vorador's
origins were even more significant -
apparently, he was the first human
to whom the dark gift had been passed.
This
was the Vampires' desperate bid
to preserve their bloodline...
for their enemies had cursed them not only with blood-thirst,
but with sterility as well.
