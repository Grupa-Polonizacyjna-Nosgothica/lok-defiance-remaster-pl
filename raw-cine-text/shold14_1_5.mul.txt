-- Yes...
I understand...
...it will be done...
the stage is set...
You needn't linger in the shadows, Kain.
It has been a long time,
hasn't it?
-- No banter, Moebius.
You know why I'm here.
-- Yes...
Raziel.
You sought to introduce your own pawn
into this game,
and now he's been
swept from the board.
-- By your hand, I suspect.
Where is he?
-- Perhaps you should ask
"when"?
How humiliating it must be for you
to come begging at my doorstep
for answers.
-- Enough wordplay -
-- Don't threaten me, Kain --
-- you see,
I have the upper hand.
How remarkable
that the great Kain
should succumb to the scepter's power
like any common vampire.
Still so arrogant
after all these years -
thinking you've devised some
brilliant plan.
You know nothing.
You have read the signs
but missed their meaning.
You believe you are that myth
of Vampire prophecy -
the Scion of Balance -
and that Raziel holds the key
to fulfilling your destiny.
-- But your messianic delusions
have blinded you
to Raziel's true nature.
You have no idea what you've unleashed.
There was a time
when you might have heeded wise counsel
when it was offered.
Now, your vanity
has made you witless.
You will have to learn the truth
for yourself.
You'll be needing this.
Your strength will return after I have departed.
But by then,
you will have more urgent concerns
than pursuing me.
Perhaps,
when we next meet,
you will have learned
a little humility.
These strange creatures seemed to manifest
from the very shadows.
