-- Do you see?
However far you stray,
you will always return to me.
Surrender, Raziel.
-- Never.
-- Your efforts are wasted, Raziel.
That weapon you bear,
however endowed,
remains only a wraith blade.
It cannot touch me.
-- I will not be your prisoner.
-- You have no choice.
Your task is fulfilled.
Kain has been cleared from the board,
and this chamber made ready
for my more malleable servants.
There is nothing more for you to do.
-- I refuse to bend my will -
-- it has always been my will you satisfy,
never your own.
-- You parasitic fraud -
you're forced to imprison me
because I possess free will--
-- you possess nothing.
As you are undying,
your soul cannot be returned to the Wheel -
but it may console you
to abide here in eternity
with me.
Moebius, my good servant,
I call you to the place of our first meeting.
Return to me here...
