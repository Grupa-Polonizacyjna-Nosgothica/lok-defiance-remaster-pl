-- It is accomplished.
The Forge summons the spirit
of every Balance Guardian to itself,
for this final purpose.
-- Ariel?
You?
-- Yes, Raziel -
yet I am much more than I was.
My spirit,
united with the souls of my predecessors,
is drawn here now
for the final baptism of the blade.
To restore Balance,
the sword must be rendered pure
by Spirit.
Release me,
Raziel -
the Soul Reaver has the power.
Release us all.
For this we were called.
You have done well, Raziel.
But there is one more trial for you to bear.
You must unite
what has been set asunder...
only then will the Scion of Balance be armed
for his true endeavor.
Only then...
-- The Reaver now blazed with purifying flame.
But far from being enlightened,
I found myself entangled in
an even greater web of mysteries.
What had Janos expected me to learn?
And what of Ariel's cryptic message?
If the sword was endowed for the Scion of Balance -
for Kain -
and he was now dead,
what hope remained?
I needed to find Janos, and soon.
I dreaded to think what these
ominous rumblings might portend.
