-- In my absence, the estate had been overrun by Moebius's soldiers.
I hoped that they had not yet found the entrance to the crypt,
or discovered the body of Janos.
Of Vorador, there was no sign.
-- Raziel -
the conquering hero.
I understand we are to offer
congratulations.
Kain,
at last,
is dead.
-- I suppose you expect similar congratulations
on the death of Vorador?
Or has he eluded you?
-- We have him.
But not without
a considerable price in blood.
-- That will have pleased him.
-- Let it sustain him
until his head is off,
and every vampire in Nosgoth at last
is dead.
-- And will that knowledge sustain you?
You too are going to your death.
-- For a true servant of the one God,
death is never bitter.
I will go -
again at peace with the knowledge
that I have played my small part
in our master's plans.
Kain
is at last destroyed,
and you
have carried out the deed.
Which hero do you think you are now?
The vampire savior?
Or the other one?
Have you realized yet
that it didn't matter to us
which one either of you thought you were,
so long as the result was the same
in the end?
And now,
Kain is dead.
Really,
I cannot thank you enough.
-- So
this has all been arranged,
every step of the way.
And Kain thought I truly had free will.
-- Oh,
but you do.
And there's the greatest triumph of all,
to have compelled the one player
who could choose
into doing exactly what we required.
Well done,
faithful servant.
And now -
I have an execution to see to.
