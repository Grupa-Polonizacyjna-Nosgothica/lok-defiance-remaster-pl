-- ... the Hylden
are merely an inconvenient consequence.
They will be dealt with in time.
It's a small price to pay
for Kain's death.
-- You're a bit premature.
-- Kain!?
-- Is there a crack in your omniscience
after all, Moebius?
First your omniscience,
and now your powers.
You are slipping badly.
-- This is not possible...
-- The part of me that staff affected
is no longer in its place.
But you already knew that,
didn't you.
I always was considered heartless.
And now, Moebius,
it is time.
-- To kill me?
Again?
for every problem:
kill -
-- This is not a debate.
You see, this time,
you have nothing that I want.
You think
this will matter?
I serve One
who has power over life and death.
-- Then go to him.
-- I am
his obedient...
his devoted servant...
Soon,
all pain will fade,
and my master
will bring me life
once more.
-- Master,
my apologies,
a momentary oversight.
Somehow Kain still lives,
and has unexpectedly dispatched me.
Make use of your good servant,
and --
-- Go to your master, then.
I release you to the Wheel.
-- Ohh...
god - no ...
-- Do you see it now?
The monster that you served?
Is this what you imagined
when you worshipped it?
-- No...
-- And in that knowledge,
go -
and feed it.
I release you.
-- Your petty actions are irrelevant,
Raziel.
Moebius was a good servant,
but he was of no further use.
His long life had run its course.
You see? -
even when you rebel,
you are doing my will.
-- Perhaps,
but something has changed, hasn't it?
You didn't foresee Kain's return.
-- You have both traced your paths along the Wheel -
this is where the journey ends.
-- You haven't the means to kill either one of us.
-- Ah, but you can be stopped.
And you will come to understand
how oblivion can be a mercy.
You and Kain
will spend eternity buried here together,
praying for the merciful release of a death
that will never come.
But I was armed with newfound knowledge,
and it burned within me...
-- ...redeemer and destroyer...
-- Moebius had never seen his master
until the Soul Reaver purified his sight.
Even the ancient Vampires had no idea
what it was they so righteously worshipped.
-- ... you must unite that which has been set asunder...
-- All the conflict and the strife throughout history,
all the fear and hatred,
served but one purpose -
to keep my master's Wheel turning.
All souls were prisoners,
trapped in the pointless round of existence,
leading distracted,
blunted lives
until death returned them -
always in ignorance -
to the Wheel.
... the coin is still turning...
-- But what hope had there been?
One cannot fight the unseen.
-- ...only then
will the Scion of Balance be armed
for his true endeavor...
-- Despair, Raziel.
There is no escape.
-- It was then I knew what I had to do.
I alone
could end this.
-- Kain...
-- Do you so enjoy death--
-- Yes...
-- Raziel? -
No -
-- Yes -
this is how...
--No,
Raziel!
-- The Soul Reaver -
pure of all corruption --
this
is what it is for.
This
is what I am for --
The two
become one -
both
Soul Reavers -
together -
and the Scion
of Balance
is healed.
And I --
am not your enemy -
not
your destroyer -
I am,
as before,
your right hand.
Your sword.
-- No,
Raziel -
this can't be the way...
-- And now
you will see --
the true enemy --
-- Raziel --
And it was then --
I saw.
-- So...
I am revealed to you at last.
-- What in the hell...
-- I am the origin of Life...
the devourer of Death.
I am the hub of the Wheel,
the purifying cycle
to which all souls
must be drawn.
-- Had I condemned Raziel to this nightmare
when I cast him into the abyss?
-- You may ponder the futility
of your ambitions
as you spend a deathless eternity
beneath a mountain of rubble.
You and your Soul Reaver
will go equally mad
as the eons pass.
The Citadel of the apostates
will become
your living tomb.
-- Your words are heartening -
-- for you would not fear us
unless we could truly do you harm.
No!
You are nothing!
-- False god--
--this
is the end -
the final turn
of your Wheel.
