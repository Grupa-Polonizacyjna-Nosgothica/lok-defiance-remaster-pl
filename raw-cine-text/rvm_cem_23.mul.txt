This edifice,
marked with the elemental Light symbol,
was clearly much older
than the ruins in the rest of the cemetery.
The door was far too high to reach.
And to open it,
it seemed the Reaver would need to be imbued with the
power of Darkness.
Clearly
I had more to accomplish
before I could discover what lay within.
