The resemblance I bore to the adversary
mocked all my hopes.
Had Kain been the Vampire hero of
prophecy all along?
Did he suspect what I was?
For if I was this foretold adversary,
then Moebius was right,
and had always been right --
I was destined to fight Kain,
and destroy him...
or be destroyed.
What part did free will play in any of this?...
