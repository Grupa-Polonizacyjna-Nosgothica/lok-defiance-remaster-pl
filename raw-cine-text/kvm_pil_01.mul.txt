How strange
to see this place long before my birth...
centuries before the corruption set in
that would poison the land,
and put me on the treacherous path
I still followed.
In the future,
these edifices
would be condemned to darkness and decay.
I would cause their fall,
and build my empire upon their ruins.
Was it still possible
that with the right knowledge,
the right moves,
I might one day see Nosgoth restored,
the Pillars pure once more?
My answer -
according to Moebius -
lay somewhere to the west of this place.
I could restore the world,
perhaps.
But never again
could I give Nosgoth back her innocence.
