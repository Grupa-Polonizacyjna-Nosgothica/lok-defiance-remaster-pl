I had seen this symbol throughout these ruins...
I should have realized what it was they worshipped.
Now there was no question.
For this scene depicted the ancient Vampires'
torment and despair
as their curse cast them from the Wheel of Fate.
So this was the god
whose abandonment had driven them to madness
and suicide.
Finally I understood -
it was not the blood-thirst,
but their immortality
that was the true nature of their enemies' curse.
The wisest,
strongest,
most noble race --
gulled by the voice of that old parasite.
But I had seen him -
and whatever he was,
he was no god.
