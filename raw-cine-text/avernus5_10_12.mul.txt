-- Come to me, my undead son.
Make haste to the Pillars -
the stage is set for the grand finale.
You will have your vengeance.
-- Mortanius.
-- So you have come out into the open, at last -
the Binding must be fragile indeed.
But you will find you are too late.
-- What am I too late for this time?
-- No.
No -- not now --
You are too late for the victory you sought.
I have beaten you after all.
-- You have mistaken my identity.
-- Have I?
You forget who schooled me in the ancient prophecies--
-- This vessel speaks truly -
you are indeed overdue.
But it no longer matters in the least.
With or without you -
we will prevail.
-- So
I finally meet the 'Unspoken' -
And here it is
nestled in the heart of the Circle itself.
Ironic.
-- Poetic justice,
to topple the foundations of the Pillars from within.
We shall have our revenge,
in full measure,
and for all time.
Ah...
this one has little strength left.
One must not break him --
-- Your kind does not like to lose.
-- I seek the Heart of Darkness.
-- Ah,
now you think of that.
But as I told you, you are too late.
The Heart has served its function.
I have used it to set prophecy in motion.
I created the champion foretold
by my masters,
who is destined to be your destroyer.
The Scion of Balance will save Nosgoth --
the Pillars will return to vampire guardianship
as intended,
and your race will be cast down forever.
-- Kain.
You used the Heart of Darkness to create Kain.
-- How else?
I refused at first to believe the ancient myths.
I thought the vampires were simply a plague
upon mankind,
a pestilence we had to control.
But they were right,
and we were wrong to overthrow them -
Moebius and I.
We didn't understand what it was the Pillars were holding back.
I have made my atonement.
I will continue to make it to the end,
which will be soon,
now.
But I know -
Kain will set it right,
he will restore Balance --
And none too soon.
My enemy is growing stronger.
-- Where is the Heart of Darkness now?
Did you destroy it?
-- You still don't understand, do you.
You cannot make use of it as long as
Kain guards it with his life.
-- Kain -- has it?
It is in Kain!
-- Check and mate.
This deed will redeem first me
and then all Nosgoth.
It must, it --
unh --
-- This one grows weak.
But we will soon have a stronger vessel.
The long-awaited hour approaches -
our release is at hand --
-- Ah...
I must --
finish it.
Now --
