-- Hash'ak'gik!
Hash'ak'gik!
Hash'ak'gik!
-- Great Hash'ak'gik,
we hear you.
-- We tremble and we obey.
-- We offer this sacrifice upon the
altar of the world.
-- The blood of our first born
do we sacrifice to you.
-- In the depths of Avernus Cathedral
I stumbled upon a bloody ritual.
Was this the source of the corruption
that had overtaken the city?
-- May this blood nourish you
for all eternity.
-- Avert your wrath from us,
great God.
-- The wrath of Hash'ak'gik
has once more been averted.
Depart now, as ever,
in his service.
-- We tremble, and we obey.
Praise to Hash'ak'gik,
and ever praise!
Hash'ak'gik!
Hash'ak'gik!
Hash'ak'gik!
