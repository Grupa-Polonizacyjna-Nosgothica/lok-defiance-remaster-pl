I sought to unravel the mystery of my fate,
and in this image lay my first clue.
For this scene depicted the forging of the Reaver -
the weapon destined to become my prison -
and I recognized its maker.
The years had changed him,
but this was unmistakably the vampire Vorador -
and in this era,
he still lived.
If I could reach him
before Moebius's mob hunted him down,
he would provide the answers I sought.
