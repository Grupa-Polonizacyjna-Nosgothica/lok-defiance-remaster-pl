These were Moebius's hunters -
mercenaries enlisted in his crusade
to exterminate the vampires.
His insignia was unmistakable...
but this meant I'd been captive in the underworld
for centuries.
I had lost five hundred years.
Then I knew what ghost it was
that haunted the Pillars --
Ariel,
the specter of the murdered Balance Guardian.
Perhaps she could provide the answers I sought.
But first I would have to find a way
out of this cemetery...
