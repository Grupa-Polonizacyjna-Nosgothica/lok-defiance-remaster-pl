I was confronted again
with depictions of the Vampires' champion,
the bearer of the Reaver blade.
And here too was his Hylden adversary,
with blazing eyes brandishing a flaming sword.
Two heroes locked in combat
which only one would survive.
But which one?
These murals prophesied two
possible outcomes.
I didn't know what Moebius
was trying to concoct,
but this all seemed too convenient...
