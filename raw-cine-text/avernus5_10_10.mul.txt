-- What was it that these deluded humans worshipped
with such fervor?
Was this the dreaded 'Unspoken'
that Vorador had warned me about?
Whatever so-called god inhabited
this hideous pit --
I was about to meet it.
I smell no blood.
Throat cut first,
blood gouting,
then it falls into the pit...
The sacrifice is rejected.
You will know my wrath --
Not possible.
No.
It could not be --
-- Stand away, monster.
-- No.
That voice --
not possible.
I know that voice...
but he fell.
The abyss,
he ended there.
-- I did not fall into the abyss.
-- Oh,
it remembers that,
does it?
I was thrown in,
by my own brethren.
-- I heard what you did
to them...
And now,
you have found me
at last.
-- ...Turel.
-- Turel.
Yes.
That was my name then.
-- The others were grotesque, but --
-- Yes -
I am changed.
I have become a god.
Greater than you ever were,
Raziel.
You were never
a god.
Greater even than Kain!
-- It is to you
that these humans offer their
blood sacrifices?
-- "Hash'ak'gik...
Hash'ak'gik..."
Yes.
-- But how did this happen? ...
-- I was summoned.
There was darkness,
and great hunger.
And then I was...
found.
-- Why do you stay in this terrible place?
-- Why
stay?
Would I remain if I could
get out?
While they hound me
and tear at me
and --
-- The hour is at hand.
As it was foretold.
-- Turel?
-- We use his voice
to command the disciples above.
We demand offerings to keep the host alive.
He has been a durable vessel,
but he can take us no further.
-- You must prevail.
The champion of our enemy draws near.
-- No!
I must have blood --
Bring me blood,
or feel the wrath of your god.
You --
yours --
yes --
it will strengthen me
against them --
-- What are you doing?
-- No --
no more questions.
No more worship.
Time to run -
time to scream -
time to die...
