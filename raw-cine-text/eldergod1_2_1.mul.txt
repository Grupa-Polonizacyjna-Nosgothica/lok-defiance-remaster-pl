-- Surrender, Raziel.
Abandon this petty rebellion.
It was I who made you.
Your life had played out,
and in my grace,
I spared you.
You are my reaper of souls.
You have no other purpose,
no higher destiny -
just this.
Accept your calling, Raziel.
Let go of these vain hopes.
Relinquish your will,
and feed.
-- No.
-- What do you profit from this defiance?
-- There's some grim satisfaction in infuriating you.
-- My patience is eternal, Raziel.
How many eons can you bear
to languish here?
The Wheel of Fate must turn;
all are redeemed in the cleansing agony
of birth, death and rebirth.
This is the Engine of life -
the purifying rhythm of the universe -
to which all souls
are irresistibly drawn.
Yours is a necessary
and noble function, Raziel.
-- Enough of your sermonizing -
are you trying to bore me into submission?
Why must this game go on?
We both know what you are.
You're no better than the vampires you so despise --
a voracious parasite
cloaking its appetite
in a shroud of righteousness.
I refuse to do your will.
-- I can see
into your heart, Raziel.
It is not your will,
but cowardice
that keeps you here.
-- How so?
-- You know what fate awaits you
when you leave the underworld.
That phantom weapon you bear
is a constant reminder, isn't it?
The Sword is waiting for you out there somewhere,
and you tarry so as
not to meet it.
-- I could not deny it.
As long as I lingered here,
defying my captor,
I was able to postpone
what I feared was my inevitable doom:
to become the ravenous spirit
imprisoned in the Reaver blade.
But that sentence was no worse
than the stalemate I now endured.
Better to face one's destiny
than cower from it.
-- Harvester of souls I created you,
and to this function, my angel of death,
you will return.
-- Enough.
Yes.
I submit.
-- Very good.
Indulge your hunger.
-- Yes...
embrace your calling, Raziel.
You will find that,
just as defiance has its price,
so obedience
has its rewards.
-- And submission is not always what it seems.
