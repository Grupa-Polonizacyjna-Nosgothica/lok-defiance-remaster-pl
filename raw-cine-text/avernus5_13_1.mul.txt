-- I awoke to find myself
in a shadowy realm.
A disquieting stillness lay
where my heart had been -
the heart that had belonged
to Janos Audron all along.
How was it possible that I still lived?
-- You are still fair of form, vampire.
-- That will go first.
-- This realm will render you hideous...
-- You will go mad,
and will not know it.
-- What is this place?
-- Do you not think of this place every day,
vampire?
-- Or are we truly
forgotten.
-- We were forgotten.
-- This is the exile
into which we were driven --
-- But soon now,
soon we will be free.
-- We will be free.
