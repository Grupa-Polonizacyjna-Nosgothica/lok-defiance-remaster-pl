I knew what ominous hour
this was in Nosgoth's history.
For here was the event
that had shaped my entire existence...
I had cast my fate,
refusing the sacrifice,
damning the Pillars,
and founding my doomed empire
upon their ruins.
I would raise the Sarafan priests
to be my closest lieutenants,
and would one day
cast the strongest of them,
my servant Raziel,
into the abyss -
dealing one last hand
to play against Fate.
But in the end,
had it made any difference?
Had I misread the signs,
as Moebius told me?
In my arrogance,
had I missed
my cast at destiny?
