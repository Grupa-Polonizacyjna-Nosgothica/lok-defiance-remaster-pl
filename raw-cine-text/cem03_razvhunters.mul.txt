-- she says she won't go near the place.
-- I tell you the Pillars are haunted --
-- Haunted!
-- I heard a woman's voice, talking and moaning --
and there was no one there.
-- How many vampires have you killed?
And you can't face down one ghost?
-- I knew who these were:
vampire hunters,
scouring the countryside,
destroying what had once been my kind.
-- My god -- what is that?
A vampire?
Or a demon?
-- Where?
-- Here.
-- Get him!
-- Quickly!
No mercy!
