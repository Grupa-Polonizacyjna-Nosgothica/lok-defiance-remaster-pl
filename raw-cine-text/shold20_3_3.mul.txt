-- Here you are at last.
I see you found a
fragment of the Balance Emblem.
This will be of even further use to you -
if you can find the other three.
Now,
shall we - ?
-- Yes.
Let us continue our conversation --
-- but on a somewhat different footing.
Now -
what do you have to tell me, Moebius?
-- You cannot kill me.
We both know that this is not how -
or when -
I die.
-- Death
is not the only possible outcome.
Your delusions
of fulfilling the Vampires' foolish prophecies
have badly distorted your judgment.
And Raziel is not what you think.
-- You dare imagine what I think?
-- So
you prevented Raziel's soul
from entering the Reaver.
Do you believe for a moment
that by this you have averted your fate?
Or his?
Or that of Nosgoth itself?
Your manipulations
are pathetic.
-- Yet Raziel retains his free will.
And that's what frightens you,
isn't it, Moebius.
You cannot see his path,
and so you cannot control it.
-- And neither can you.
Yes, Raziel is shrouded from us,
but we see the ripples
of his potential actions.
And every path he might choose
leads to the same outcome:
he will kill you, Kain.
In sparing Raziel,
you have written your own
death sentence.
-- You still have not answered the question I came to ask --
where is Raziel?
-- He is not,
in a true sense,
here.
Not now.
-- Don't
try my patience, Moebius.
What have you done with him?
-- He is contained.
In time,
it may be safe to release him.
His destiny must be completed -
he will enter the sword.
But until that time
he is dangerous --
far more dangerous than you could understand.
-- And your incontrovertible evidence?
-- The answers are plain
if you know where to look.
Go west of the Pillars -
there you will find a testament
written in stone.
-- But stones, too, can lie.
