You ...
-- No -
Raziel--
-- Vae victis--
-- I didn't--
'Woe to the conquered' -
I have found the Heart of Darkness.
And you -
go to oblivion.
Kain was gone.
The madness of this place
had somehow fueled my rage,
and as it subsided
I felt no elation,
no sense of victory.
Only a calm certainty
that we had once again walked
blindly into our enemies' trap.
I couldn't be sure whether Kain had truly intended
to destroy me -
and now it appeared
I would never know.
