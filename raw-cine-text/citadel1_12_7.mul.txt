-- Janos!
What is this?!
all is lost.
-- We had arrived at that cataclysmic moment,
when a younger Kain
faced his fateful dilemma as Balance Guardian.
Choosing self-preservation over sacrifice,
he doomed the Pillars to eternal ruin.
-- Raziel,
there may yet be hope.
There is One who will be called;
you must seek the Scion of Balance--
Dear god...
-- Ah, Raziel,
we meet again.
You have played your part flawlessly.
It is gratifying to attain both
freedom and vengeance
in a single stroke.
-- No - you can not...
-- This one is strong...
good.
My next move requires a more
durable host.
Mortals are such fragile vessels.
Willing or not,
you have provided the instrument of our victory.
-- I wouldn't celebrate just yet.
-- You pathetic creature -
you haven't got a clue.
The seduction of the Circle
and possession of Mortanius;
Ariel's murder;
the corruption and collapse of the Pillars:
all orchestrated
as a prelude to this moment.
We sought an incorruptible vessel,
and you provided one.
We required the blood of
our ancient enemy,
and you delivered
Janos Audron -
having first been lured
to the Heart of Darkness.
Best of all,
you murdered
the Scion of Balance to get it.
We've already won.
-- Raziel,
you must not allow them to carry out their plan.
Kill me,
and you end it now.
-- Suicidal, like the rest of them.
Know your place, Raziel.
The true hero plays his role,
and then steps aside.
You deluded ghoul.
Do you so wish to die a martyr
for the Vampires' lost cause?
-- You're not leaving this chamber.
I will destroy Janos if I have to.
-- Very well then,
I'll indulge you...
