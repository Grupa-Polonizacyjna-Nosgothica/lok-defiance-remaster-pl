-- So...
our wretched little savior returns...
Come to join the last pathetic
battle of the vampire race?
But on which side, I wonder...
-- I've not come to fight you, Vorador.
-- You don't know why you're here.
-- I know this much:
that you are the author of my fate -
and as such,
only you can rewrite it.
-- You give me too much credit.
-- You forged the Reaver -
I have seen the evidence.
-- I was its maker, yes.
-- Then you know its purpose.
-- No -
only the scraps of prophecy
my master shared with me.
-- And do these scraps explain
why you would forge a weapon to imprison your savior?
Ah, well then...
it seems we have our answer.
You've chosen your path.
-- I have chosen nothing.
I've been deceived at every turn.
You seem to know what I am.
Tell me.
-- I thought I did,
once.
But now all the prophecies have failed.
The Pillars are corrupted...
I am the last of my kind...
and when Moebius's hunters find me,
it will have all been for nothing.
-- You've forgotten about Kain.
-- Ah yes, Kain...
I fear he shoulders a greater burden than he realizes.
I cannot help you -
even if I was inclined to.
I crafted the Reaver blade,
but only at the behest of my sire,
Janos Audron.
What sorcery he and the others
laid upon the sword afterward,
I cannot say.
-- Janos tried to give me the Reaver before he died.
He said that it had been forged for me...
but what did he mean?
As my weapon,
or my prison?
-- Perhaps you should ask him yourself.
-- Janos is here?
-- In a manner of speaking.
The greatest of us all -
the father of our race.
The Sarafan tore the heart from his living body
five centuries ago.
-- But there's no sign of decay -
how is this possible after all these years?
-- Somewhere,
the Heart still beats.
And while it does,
the body will remain preserved.
If his Heart could be restored,
Janos might yet be raised.
-- And you haven't tried to recover it,
in all these years?
-- Many times...
but our enemies hid the Heart too well.
It was taken as a trophy to Avernus Cathedral
centuries ago,
where they christened it
'the Heart of Darkness.'
Believing that it embodies the essence
of our dark gift,
they hid the Heart away,
lest it fall into the wrong hands.
Our hands.
Redeem yourself -
you may be our last hope.
Perhaps you alone can find the Heart,
if it is meant to be found.
If Janos can be resurrected,
he will have all the answers you require.
This key
will open your way to Avernus.
But be advised,
there are dark sorceries at work in the cathedral.
You must be on your guard.
