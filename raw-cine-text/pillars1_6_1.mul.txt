-- Once again
I beheld the Pillars of Nosgoth -
crumbling in decay now,
following the corruption of the Circle.
Here I would find Ariel,
the specter of the murdered Balance Guardian -
and the last pure,
undefiled member of the Guardian Circle.
Bound here upon her death,
she was doomed to haunt these Pillars
until her successor fulfilled his terrible duty,
and Balance was restored.
-- What manner of creature approaches?
-- I know you well, Ariel -
though you do not yet know me.
-- I have no time for riddles,
strange one.
-- All you have is time.
I have come to seek your guidance--
-- I counsel only one man,
and you are not he.
But you will know him soon.
The contagion of your kind
is coming to an end.
-- My kind?
What exactly do you think I am?
-- Your name shall remain
'Unspoken',
as decreed by our ancestors.
You serve the one who so brutally took my life
and set this tragedy in motion.
But even now,
hope is at work.
Balance will be restored,
and your kind will be expelled forever.
-- You have pinned your hopes on Kain.
He will disappoint you.
-- What can you know of Kain?
-- More than you could ever fathom.
-- He will do what he must when the time comes.
-- By choosing his own death?
A sacrifice for the world?
You don't know Kain very well.
-- I know what he is called to do.
My faith sustains me.
-- Is it faith,
or fear?
You know that if Kain refuses the sacrifice,
you will never leave here.
And you begin to suspect...
-- I will not hear your poison, fiend.
-- Grant me the answers I require,
and I will leave you to your pathetic delusions.
-- Ask, then.
-- I seek the vampire Vorador.
-- To kill him, perhaps?
Or to join him in death?
But for Kain, he is the last of his kind.
Moebius's mob has done its work.
-- My reasons are my own.
-- His refuge lies in the heart of the black forest.
And may you molder there together
until the end comes.
