This history, in part,
I knew already...
How, as the Vampires began to die out,
the Pillars summoned human Guardians
to fulfill their roles.
It seemed the ancient Vampires had adopted -
and, when necessary,
abducted -
the human Guardians,
and made vampires of them when they came of age.
Until the humans rebelled
against their masters...
And here
I made a surprising discovery:
it was Moebius the Time Streamer,
and Mortanius,
Guardian of Death,
who led the bloody revolt.
Now
I understood why Moebius hated me
so intensely.
I was the first vampire Guardian
in all these centuries -
and he knew what my coming signified.
...or perhaps
I reminded him of all he had forsaken.
