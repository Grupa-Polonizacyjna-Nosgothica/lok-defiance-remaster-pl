-- This relic had come at so high a cost...
my blood offering for the answers I sought
from this enigmatic corpse.
<T4
It was the price of my freedom,
for which Kain had paid with his life.
Had I journeyed so far
and forsaken so much,
only to have it end like this?
-- I...  remember!
Raziel...
the heir of prophecy...
You came for the Reaver
just before the Sarafan found me.
You've been entombed here for five centuries.
Your murderers are long dead.
-- Five hundred years?
And Vorador...?
--also dead.
Your bloodline is erased.
The age of the vampires is coming to an end.
-- Then we must waste no time
I'm not who you think I am.
Nor is this a benevolent act.
I have questions that apparently you alone can answer.
-- Raziel,
There are forces in this world
that will strive to deceive you
and pervert your destiny.
But you must believe...
of the Vampire race.
Why then would the Vampires devise a weapon to
consume and imprison their savior?
-- No...
That cannot be...
While the blade yet exists,
I am drawn inexorably toward my doom.
It was you who bound me to this fate.
Only you can release me.
-- Raziel, you have been misled.
You are ordained by prophecy to wield the Reaver.
And so I do...
though not quite as you'd envisioned.
Redeemer and destroyer...
Did I misread all the signs?
It seems your destiny is more labyrinthian
than I had imagined.
You must trust me, Raziel...
We may have very little time.
I will convey you to the place
where your answers lie.
